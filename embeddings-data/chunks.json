NYLAGo is your interface for creating cryptocurrency transfer commands. \n\n**Step 2: Click on the Send tab**\nIn NYLAGo interface, locate and click the 'Send' tab.  This is where you create transfer commands to send tokens to other people.  The Send tab contains form fields for recipient, amount, and network selection. \n\n**Step 3: Enter recipient's username**\nType the recipient's X. com (Twitter) username in the recipient field.  Important: Enter ONLY the username without the @ symbol.  For example, if sending to @alice, just type 'alice'.

Then select the token type from the dropdown (SOL for Solana, ETH for Ethereum, ALGO for Algorand, etc. ).  Double-check the amount is correct before proceeding. \n\n**Step 5: Select blockchain network**\nChoose the blockchain network that matches your token type.  CRITICAL: Network must match token (SOL=Solana, ETH=Ethereum, ALGO=Algorand).  Cross-chain transfers are NOT supported - you can only send within the same network. \n\n**Step 6: Generate transfer command**\nClick the 'Send to X. com' or 'Generate Command' button to create your transfer command.  NYLAGo will generate a specially formatted command that NYLA can understand and execute.  This command contains all your transfer details in a secure format. \n\n**Step 7: Copy and post command on X. com**\nCopy the generated command to your clipboard, then go to X. com (Twitter) and create a new post.
