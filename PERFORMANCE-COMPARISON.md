## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### **Puppeteer Optimizations Applied**
```javascript
// Launch browser with performance optimizations
await puppeteer.launch({
  headless: 'new', // Use new headless mode
  args: [
    '--no-sandbox',
    '--disable-setuid-sandbox',
    '--disable-dev-shm-usage',
    '--disable-accelerated-2d-canvas',
    '--no-first-run',
    '--disable-default-apps',
    '--disable-extensions',
    '--disable-background-timer-throttling'
  ]
});
```

### **Splash Screen Skip Implementation**
Both frameworks use optimized splash screen skipping:
```javascript
// Skip splash screen immediately
await page.evaluate(() => {
  const splashScreen = document.getElementById('splashScreen');
  const appContainer = document.getElementById('appContainer');
  
  if (splashScreen && appContainer) {
    splashScreen.style.display = 'none';
    appContainer.style.opacity = '1';
    
    // Trigger app initialization
    const event = new Event('DOMContentLoaded');
    document.dispatchEvent(event);
  }
});
```

### **Test Structure Comparison**

| Aspect | Playwright | Puppeteer |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| **Test Structure** | Describe blocks + individual tests | Class-based with methods |
