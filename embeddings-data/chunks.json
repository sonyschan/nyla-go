' they want to transfer cryptocurrency to another person using NYLAGo interface. \n\n## Step-by-Step Instructions:\n\n**Step 1: Open NYLAGo application**\nLaunch NYLAGo either through the browser extension or visit https://sonyschan. github. io/nyla-go/ in your web browser.  NYLAGo is your interface for creating cryptocurrency transfer commands. \n\n**Step 2: Click on the Send tab**\nIn NYLAGo interface, locate and click the 'Send' tab.  This is where you create transfer commands to send tokens to other people.  The Send tab contains form fields for recipient, amount, and network selection. \n\n**Step 3: Enter recipient's username**\nType the recipient's X. com (Twitter) username in the recipient field.  Important: Enter ONLY the username without the @ symbol.  For example, if sending to @alice, just type 'alice'.  This username-based system makes transfers much easier than using long wallet addresses. \n\n**Step 4: Choose token amount and type**\nEnter the exact amount of tokens you want to send in the amount field.  Then select the token type from the dropdown (SOL for Solana, ETH for Ethereum, ALGO for Algorand, etc. ).  Double-check the amount is correct before proceeding. \n\n**Step 5: Select blockchain network**\nChoose the blockchain network that matches your token type.  CRITICAL: Network must match token (SOL=Solana, ETH=Ethereum, ALGO=Algorand).  Cross-chain transfers are NOT supported - you can only send within the same network",

Paste the command exactly as generated - do not edit or modify it.  Post the command publicly so NYLA can see and process it. \n\n**Step 8: Wait for NYLA confirmation**\nAfter posting your command, NYLA will automatically detect it and execute the transfer.  NYLA will reply to your post with confirmation details including transaction hash and status.  This usually takes 30-60 seconds depending on network congestion. \n\n## Prerequisites:\n- Active X. com (Twitter) account\n- Wallet with sufficient token balance\n- Internet connection\n- Recipient's X. com username\n\n## Common Issues and Solutions:\n\n**Issue**: Using @ symbol in username\n**Solution**: Enter username without @.

Avoid screenshots that reduce quality. \n\n**Issue**: Screen glare making QR unreadable\n**Solution**: Tilt device to avoid glare, use matte screen protector, or scan in different lighting conditions. \n\n**Issue**: Camera won't focus on QR code\n**Solution**: Tap screen to focus manually, clean camera lens, or try scanning from different distances",
