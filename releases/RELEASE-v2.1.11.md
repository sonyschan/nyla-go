- **7-day retention policy** - Old backups automatically cleaned to save storage
- **Emergency fallbacks** - Session storage for crash recovery
- **Export capability** - Download knowledge data as JSON for manual backup

### 🔗 Comprehensive Blockchain Knowledge Base

#### Network Information Enhanced
| Network | Consensus | TPS | Avg Fee | Native Token |
|---------|-----------|-----|---------|--------------|
| Solana | PoH + PoS | 65,000 | $0.0001 | SOL |
| Ethereum | PoS | 15-30 | $5-50+ | ETH |
| Algorand | Pure PoS | 6,000 | $0.001 | ALGO |

#### Added Knowledge Categories
- **Technical Specifications** - Consensus mechanisms, transaction speeds, fee structures
- **Ecosystem Highlights** - Major protocols, DEXs, NFT marketplaces for each network
- **Community Resources** - Discord servers, developer portals, hackathons
- **Foundation Information** - Official websites, grant programs, documentation

### ℹ️ User Experience Improvements

#### NYLA Tab Disclaimer
```
ℹ️ Important Notice
NylaGo is a community run application, it does not have 
access to NYLA CORE. It is a helper application that pre 
formats commands to Nyla. Nyla still processes and handles 
requests the same way she would normally.
```

#### Enhanced Error Handling
- Graceful storage corruption recovery
- Clear user notifications for data issues
- Improved debug logging for developers
