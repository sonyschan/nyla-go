# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Verified Safe & Secure

NYLA Go is committed to providing a secure browser extension for cryptocurrency transfers. We implement multiple layers of security verification:

### ✅ Security Measures
- **Open Source**: Full source code available for public audit
- **No External Code**: All functionality self-contained, no remote code execution
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only essential browser permissions requested
- **Local Data**: Form preferences stored locally, never transmitted to our servers
- **Transparent External Services**: Clear disclosure of QR generation services used

### 🔍 Third-Party Verification
