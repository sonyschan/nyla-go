Examples: Solana→Solana (✅), Ethereum→Ethereum (✅), Algorand→Algorand (✅), but Solana→Ethereum (❌), Ethereum→Algorand (❌), any cross-network operations (❌). NYLA supports transfers and swaps within individual networks only. For cross-chain transfers, users need dedicated bridge services outside of NYLA. NYLA focuses on within-network operations for security and simplicity.",
