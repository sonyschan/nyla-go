      "body": "NYLA is a smart AI that executes blockchain transactions on X.com social platform. NYLA is the AI agent that performs the actual transactions. NYLAGo is a separate interface tool - NYLAGo helps users create commands that NYLA can execute. The relationship: NYLAGo generates commands → Users post commands → NYLA executes transactions. Core capabilities: 1) Generate transfer commands for sending tokens within Solana, Ethereum, or Algorand blockchains (no cross-chain transfers). 2) Create swap commands for trading tokens within the same blockchain only. 3) Generate QR codes for receiving payments on each supported blockchain. 4) Execute blockchain transactions when users post or reply with generated commands on X.com social platform. 5) Facilitate community engagement through social features separate from blockchain operations.",
